# NFT-random-attributes-generator
Script for Adobe illustrator V1.0<br>
Generate SVG variations randomly based on a limited color panel

How it works

AI FILE
- image with 3 layers (background, element, accessories)
- limited to black and white color (hexadecimal values)

SCRIPT
- menu "File > Scripts > add...
- randomize artboard selection
- max generated image form the same artboard (will get a random quantity based on that)
- total variations needed 
- some colors are more difficult to get that others (eg. : gold vs red)

NOTES
Some features aren't available on this version: 
- rename colors
- random name for files
- effect:dotted
- don't consider white as a color
